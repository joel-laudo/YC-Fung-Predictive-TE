# YC-Fung-Predictive-TE

This repository contains all the code and data necessary to generate, run and postprocess the finite element simulations for the patient-specific tisse expansion (TE) case considered in this study. The repository is broken down into 2 folders. The FE Simulation folder contains all the code to generate patient-specific Abaqus input files and post-process the results to extract quantities of interest (point cloud of the deformed simulation geoemetry at the final timepoint and the total growth prediction). It also contains an example simulation FINAL_P14_Job1_MAP.inp, the maximum a posteriori estimate, as well as the UMAT file necessary to run it, P14_Controller_1V1.f and the two python files and one matlab file that read from the .odb file and calculate the quantities of interest (P14_Read_Final_Deformation_Point_Cloud.py and P14_Read_Final_Growth.py and P14_Calculate_Growth_Estimates_V2.m that calculates the area growth estimate using files generated by P14_Read_Final_Growth.py). 

The folder GP Training and MCMC stores the training and testing data files for the Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate models to learn how to predict the quantities of interest, and then perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to inform parameter posteriors. The code to train the Gaussian Processes and perform MCMC is found in the Jupyter Notebook file P14_MCMC.ipynb.
